Spring 2013 Final Project

The source code that implements the Graphical User Interface was originally written by Joshua Boren for a project in the Fall of 2012 in CS3500.  Changes will be made by Joshua Boren, Calvin Kern, Doug Hitchcock and Ethan Hayes in order to meet the requirements of the project for Spring 2013 CS 3505.

The end goal is to have a back end server that will allow concurrent collaboration on spreadsheets between users across networks.
